Digital version of [Don't Mess With Cthulhu](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/253786/dont-mess-with-cthulhu-deluxe).

This is an "offline" version where the game is played on a single device. You can play it [here](https://brynedwards.github.io/cthulhu/).

It's a static page in that there are no external requests (except for a stylesheet for [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)). I used the Typescript minimal template from [here](https://github.com/solidjs/templates) so the same instructions apply.

This repository redistributes two fonts

1. [Bellota](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/bellota)
2. [Vintage Propagandist](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/vintage-propagandist)

The font files are found in `src/assets/fonts` and the licenses for each font are in the `license` folder.
